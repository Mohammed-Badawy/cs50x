| Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief ge |
| t into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If yo |
| u have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you mig |
| ht want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that t |

| I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recogniz |
| ed. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, |
|  I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thie |
| f there withdrawing some money.                              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who |
|  talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard |
|  the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest  |
| flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the  |
| person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight  |
| ticket.                                                      |
